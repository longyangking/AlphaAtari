# AlphaAtari
> Play Atari game with Artificial intelligence

## Features
+ Deep reinforcement learning
+ Curiosity-driven Exploration by Self-supervised Prediction

## Requirements
+ Numpy
+ [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym#installing-everything)
+ Keras, Tensorflow

## Status
Working on it...

## Extra
I found that it's hard and time-consuming to make a home-made Atari game, so that I decided to exploit the external libraries to achieve this goal, i.e, OpenAI gym.
